# html-email

Why is coding HTML for Email different from web coding?

<!-- Emails have multiples clients and they all are supported differently. What one client supports another may not. Hint Outlook and Gmail email clients, as well as the different mobile platforms that run them. -->

What concepts help coders work around the limitations of HTML in Emails?

<!-- Use tables and table nesting as well as instyle tags/css. Due to multiple email clients being selective on what they can support, creating HTML emails is very specific and limited to being creative. -->
